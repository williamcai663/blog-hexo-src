## nacos 的初探

### 1、为什么要使用nacos
(1) eureka服务从2.0开始不在维护了，后期升级和维护困难;
(2) nocos支持的服务更多，包括基于DNS和基于RPC的服务，提供实时的健康检查；
(3) 更适应于云服务架构，支持多租户和多环境；

### 2、服务发现
   Dynamic Service Discovery is key to service-centric (for example microservice or cloud-native) architectures. Nacos supports both DNS-based and RPC-based (Dubbo, gRPC) service discovery, and provides real-time service health checks to prevent routing requests from being sent to unhealthy hosts or service instances. With Nacos, you can also implement circuit breakers for your services with ease.
### 3、服务配置
Dynamic Configuration Service allows you to manage configurations in all environments in a centralized, externalized, and dynamic approach. Dynamic configuration saves you from redeploying your applications and services when configuration is updated. You can implement stateless services and achieve on-demand scaling effortlessly.
